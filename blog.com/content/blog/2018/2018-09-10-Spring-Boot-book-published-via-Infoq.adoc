I am so happy because today my Spring Boot book is finally available! See https://www.infoq.com/minibooks/spring-boot-building-api-backend for all the details.

I would like to thank the people at Infoq for making this a reality: Ana and Charles.

Huge thanks to https://twitter.com/kittylyst[Ben Evans] for the technical review and Lawrence Nyveen for reviewing my English.

Further I got to thank https://twitter.com/mraible[Matt Raible] for creating the https://github.com/mraible/infoq-mini-book[InfoQ Minibook Template] so that I could write the book using https://asciidoctor.org/[Asciidoctor].

As a final thank you, these are the great open source technologies that are used in the book:

* Spring Boot: https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot
* Spring Data: https://spring.io/projects/spring-data
* Spring Security: https://spring.io/projects/spring-security
* Spring REST Docs: https://spring.io/projects/spring-restdocs
* JUnit: https://junit.org/
* AssertJ: http://joel-costigliola.github.io/assertj/
* Testcontainers: https://www.testcontainers.org/
* Mockito: https://site.mockito.org/

* Maven: https://maven.apache.org/
* H2 Database: http://www.h2database.com/

On a side note: The book uses Spring Boot 2. If there are people that want a version for Spring Boot 1, I can give that since the book started with Spring Boot 1 originally. Just contact me via email at wim dot deblauwe at gmail dot com.
