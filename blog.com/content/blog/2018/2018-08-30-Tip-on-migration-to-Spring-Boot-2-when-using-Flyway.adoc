Spring Boot 1.5.x uses Flyway 3 while Spring Boot 2.x uses Flyway 5. According to the https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/wiki/Spring-Boot-2.0-Migration-Guide#flyway[official migration guide for Spring Boot 2], you need to do 2 releases to be able to migrate an application from Spring Boot 1 to Spring Boot 2 if you are using Flyway:

____
* First upgrade your 1.5.x Spring Boot application to Flyway 4 (4.2.0 at the time of writing), see the instructions for Maven and Gradle.
* Once your schema has been upgraded to Flyway 4, upgrade to Spring Boot 2 and run the migration again to port your application to Flyway 5.
____

While this certainly works, it might not always be convenient to do 2 releases. If you don't want to do this, follow these steps as a workaround (Assuming you have access to the database):

. Migrate your Spring Boot application to Spring Boot 2 and release it so it can be deployed after running the following steps.
. Download the command line zip file of Flyway 4.2.0 from https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/flywaydb/flyway-commandline/4.2.0/
. Extract the zip file
. Copy the jar file of your 1.5.x Spring Boot application (NOT your Spring Boot 2 version!) to `<flyway-path>/jars`. NOTE: You need to copy the .original jar file that is generated by Maven or Gradle, if you use the repackage feature. Don't forget to rename it to end in `.jar` after copying, otherwise Flyway will not find it
. Edit `<flyway-path>/conf/flyway.conf`:
* Set 'flyway.url' to the value of 'spring.datasource.url' of the Spring Boot application
* Set 'flyway.locations' to the value also used in the Spring Boot application
. Run `./flyway migrate`
. Run `./flyway repair`

After this, upgrade the server to use your Spring Boot 2 migrated application.
