== About the book

Taming Thymeleaf will learn you about writing web applications with https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot[Spring Boot] and https://www.thymeleaf.org/[Thymeleaf] in no-time.
The book teaches you step-by-step how to get started with those technologies and build a fully fledged web application including security, validation, internationalization, testing, ...

Thymeleaf is an amazing technology for building server-side HTML using the Java eco-system.
Combined with Spring Boot, it is really a killer combo for a productive development environment.
Learn how to structure your code so your application can evolve for years to come.
As HTML will always be there, you can do this without having to re-write your frontend every six months for the latest JavaScript framework.

https://github.com/wimdeblauwe/taming-thymeleaf-sources[The application] that is built in the book not only functions great.
It also looks amazing as it is based on https://tailwindui.com/[Tailwind UI]. These are beautiful components based on https://tailwindcss.com/[Tailwind CSS].
