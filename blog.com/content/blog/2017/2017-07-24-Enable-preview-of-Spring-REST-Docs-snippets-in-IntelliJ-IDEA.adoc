If you use https://projects.spring.io/spring-restdocs/[Spring REST Docs], you will be using the Asciidoctor `include` directive a lot to include the request and responses that are generated from the unit tests. Drawback is that the https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7391-asciidoc[Asciidoctor plugin for IntelliJ IDEA] will not render them by default and looks like this:

The reason is simple, the `snippets` attribute is only available when running the Maven or Gradle task to build the final documentation.

As a workaround, you can add the following at the top of your document:

[source]
----

ifndef::snippets[]

:snippets: ../../../target/generated-snippets

endif::[]

----

We use the http://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#ifndef-directive[ifndef directive] to define the `snippets` attribute in case the build system did not define it yet.

Now the preview works nicely:

Note that it will only work if you are using default locations for the asciidoc source files and the generated snippets. Adjust the path if you use something else.
