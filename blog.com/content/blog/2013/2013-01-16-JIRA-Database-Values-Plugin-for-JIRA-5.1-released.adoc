I just released the new version of the JIRA Database Values Plugin. It is now compatible with JIRA 5.1 and 5.2. Most notable change is that under the hood http://jquery.com/[jQuery] is used now instead of http://script.aculo.us/[Scriptaculous].

See https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/org.deblauwe.jira.plugin.database-values-plugin[Atlassian Marketplace] for the download.

The source code has also been migrated to the excellet Bitbucket service. Sources can be found at https://bitbucket.org/wimdeblauwe/jdvp and the documentation at the embedded wiki: https://bitbucket.org/wimdeblauwe/jdvp/wiki/Home

This version would not have been possible without the people that donated on http://www.gofundme.com/1efxt4[GoFundMe] so a big thank you to them all!

Enjoy it!

Wim

PS: One breaking change is that linking of multiple custom fields is no longer supported. It never worked really well anyway and I had to remove it to support the inline editing capabilities of JIRA 5.1.
