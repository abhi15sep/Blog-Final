I have been quite busy with upgrading the JIRA Database Values Plugin to support JIRA 5.1. I never thought I would pull it off with the inline editing stuff, but it is looking good so far. If you are interested, please consider donating on http://www.gofundme.com/1efxt4 . As soon as I reach the fund goal, I will release the new version. If you donate 50 euro or more, you can get early access to test versions.
